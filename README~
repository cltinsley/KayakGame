README

This is my final project for CS174A - Intro to Computer Graphics, taken Spring 2019 at UCLA.

Most of the code I wrote is in the main-scene.js file, a skeleton for a previous project for a solar system.
I modified the code to build a simple kayak game, where the object is to get the fastest lap time possible.
All of the movement and placing of materials was done using linear algebra transformations.

To try the game yourself, run the command "Python -m SimpleHTTPServer" within the term project directory, then open a browser to localhost:8000

A similar, albeit slightly buggy version, of the project can be found at:
